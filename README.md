## 🎯 What I Do

I lead **full-cycle Odoo ERP implementations** for SMEs, NGOs, and manufacturers across the Middle East. My approach combines deep accounting and auditing expertise with hands-on project management and technical configuration skills.

**My Role:**
- 📋 **ERP Project Management** - Discovery, requirements, implementation, go-live & support
- 🔍 **Business Process Analysis** - Mapping workflows, identifying gaps, designing solutions
- ⚙️ **Odoo Configuration** - System setup, module customization, business logic implementation
- 💻 **Technical Customization** - Hands-on coding when needed (Python, JavaScript, QWeb)
- 📊 **Financial Systems Design** - Chart of accounts, reporting, compliance frameworks
- 👥 **Stakeholder Management** - Training, change management, executive reporting

**Not a full-time developer** - but I can read, modify, and write code to deliver the right solution.

## 🎓 Background

## 💡 My Approach

I bridge the gap between **business needs** and **technical solutions**. 

With a strong foundation in finance and auditing, I understand what organizations truly need from their ERP system - not just what's technically possible. I can communicate with executives about ROI and compliance, with end-users about daily workflows, and with developers about technical requirements.

When standard Odoo doesn't fit, I roll up my sleeves and code the solution. When it does fit, I configure smartly and move fast.
